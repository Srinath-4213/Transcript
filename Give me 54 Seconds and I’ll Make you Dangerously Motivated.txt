[00:00:00] Just give me under a minute and I'll change the way you look at your life.
[00:00:04] Just listen, motivation isn't given. It's built through consistent action.
[00:00:10] It's not something you're born with. It's the reward you get from making consistent progress
[00:00:16] over time. You don't get inspired without first doing the work. Every single second you waste
[00:00:22] waiting for motivation to strike, you lose the opportunity to build your dream. You don't
[00:00:27] mean motivation. What you need is discipline. The truth is motion always beats motivation.
[00:00:35] Stop waiting to feel ready for a moment that'll never arrive because you've never leveled up
[00:00:40] while you're drifting on autopilot. stop waiting to make the right decision. Instead make
[00:00:46] the decision then make it right. That's how you get motivated.
